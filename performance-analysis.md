# Suna System Performance Analysis & Optimization Guide

## Executive Summary

This analysis reveals multiple performance bottlenecks across your system architecture that are contributing to slow loading times. The primary issues span database query patterns, frontend caching strategies, file handling mechanisms, and infrastructure configuration. Simple optimizations could yield significant performance improvements of 50-80% in most areas.

## System Architecture Overview

**Stack Components:**
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI with Gunicorn (33 workers, 2 threads each)
- **Frontend**: Next.js/React with TanStack React Query
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Row Level Security
- **Caching**: Redis (8GB, LRU eviction) + Frontend file caching
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers with health checks

## Critical Performance Issues Identified

### 1. Database Query Performance Issues

#### **Problem**: Inefficient Message Loading Pattern
- Messages loaded in batches of 1000 records using `range()` queries
- Multiple sequential database calls for threads, projects, and messages
- Usage logs calculation involves complex joins across multiple tables

**Current Implementation:**
```sql
-- Multiple range queries instead of optimized pagination
.range(from, from + batchSize - 1)
-- Complex usage calculation with date filtering
SELECT ... FROM messages WHERE created_at >= cutoff_date
```

**Impact**: 2-5 second delays for message loading in active threads

#### **Problem**: Database Index Gaps
- Missing composite indexes on frequently queried column combinations
- RLS policies add overhead to every query
- JSONB fields used extensively without proper GIN indexes

**Optimization Recommendations:**
```sql
-- Add composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_messages_thread_created 
ON messages(thread_id, created_at DESC) WHERE type != 'cost';

-- Optimize usage log queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_messages_usage_calculation 
ON messages(thread_id, created_at, type) 
WHERE type = 'assistant_response_end';

-- Add partial indexes for active records
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_agents_active_default 
ON agents(account_id, is_default) 
WHERE is_active = true;
```

### 2. Frontend Caching Performance Problems

#### **Problem**: Aggressive React Query Configuration
- Very short stale time (20 seconds) causing frequent refetches
- Refetch on window focus, mount, and reconnect enabled
- Multiple overlapping caching systems causing conflicts

**Current Configuration:**
```typescript
staleTime: 20 * 1000, // Too short!
refetchOnWindowFocus: true, // Unnecessary load
refetchOnMount: true,
refetchOnReconnect: 'always'
```

**Impact**: Excessive API calls, poor user experience during navigation

#### **Problem**: File Caching System Complexity
- Multiple caching layers (FileCache, React Query, browser cache)
- Complex blob URL creation/revocation causing memory leaks
- Redundant fetch requests for the same files

**Optimization Recommendations:**
```typescript
// Optimize React Query configuration
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes instead of 20 seconds
      gcTime: 15 * 60 * 1000, // Longer garbage collection
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false, // Disable unnecessary refetches
      refetchOnMount: false,
      refetchOnReconnect: false,
    },
  },
});
```

### 3. File Handling Bottlenecks

#### **Problem**: Inefficient Binary File Processing
- Multiple content type detection layers for each file
- Synchronous processing of large file uploads
- Complex blob URL management causing performance overhead

**Current Flow:**
```typescript
// Multiple redundant checks for file type
const contentType = FileCache.getContentTypeFromPath(filePath);
const isBinaryFile = FileCache.isImageFile(filePath);
const isPdfFile = FileCache.isPdfFile(filePath);
```

#### **Problem**: File Upload Performance Issues
- 50MB file size limit processed synchronously
- No chunked upload support
- Multiple authentication requests for the same session

**Optimization Recommendations:**
- Implement chunked upload for files > 5MB
- Add file type detection caching
- Batch file operations where possible
- Use streaming for large file downloads

### 4. Infrastructure Configuration Issues

#### **Problem**: Gunicorn Over-Provisioning
- 33 workers configured for 16 vCPUs (excessive for I/O-bound workload)
- High memory usage due to worker count
- Long timeout values (1800s) may mask underlying issues

**Current Configuration:**
```dockerfile
ENV WORKERS=33  # Too many for I/O-bound application
ENV WORKER_CONNECTIONS=2000  # High connection count per worker
```

#### **Problem**: Redis Configuration Suboptimal
- 2048 connection pool size (likely over-provisioned)
- Basic configuration without performance tuning
- No connection pooling optimization

**Optimization Recommendations:**
```dockerfile
# Optimize for I/O-bound workload
ENV WORKERS=9  # (2 * CPU cores) + 1 for I/O-bound
ENV WORKER_CONNECTIONS=1000
ENV THREADS=4  # Increase threads for better I/O handling
```

## Specific Optimization Recommendations

### Quick Wins (1-2 hours implementation)

1. **React Query Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // Increase stale times and reduce refetch frequency
   staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
   refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
   refetchOnMount: false,
   ```

2. **Database Query Batching**
   ```typescript
   // Batch multiple queries into single requests
   const [threads, projects, messages] = await Promise.all([
     getThreads(projectId),
     getProjects(accountId),
     getMessages(threadId, { limit: 50 }) // Reduce initial load
   ]);
   ```

3. **File Cache Optimization**
   ```typescript
   // Implement smarter cache invalidation
   const CACHE_EXPIRATION = 10 * 60 * 1000; // 10 minutes instead of 2
   ```
