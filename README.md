## Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/images/diagram.png)

OperaFlow consists of four main components working together to provide a complete operational AI platform:

### Backend API

Python/FastAPI service that handles REST endpoints, thread management, and LLM integration with Anthropic, OpenAI, and others via LiteLLM. The backend orchestrates all AI operations and manages the communication between different system components.

### Frontend

Next.js/React application providing a responsive UI with chat interface, dashboard, agent configuration, and real-time monitoring. Built with modern web technologies including Tailwind CSS and TypeScript for a seamless user experience.

### Agent Execution Environment

Isolated Docker-based execution environment for every agent with browser automation, code interpreter, file system access, tool integration, and comprehensive security features. Each agent operates in its own sandbox for maximum security and reliability.

### Supabase Database

Handles data persistence with authentication, user management, conversation history, file storage, agent state, analytics, and real-time subscriptions. Provides a robust foundation for multi-tenant operations.

## Self-Hosting

OperaFlow can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure using our comprehensive setup wizard. For a complete guide to self-hosting OperaFlow, please refer to our [Self-Hosting Guide](./docs/SELF-HOSTING.md).

The setup process includes:

- Setting up a Supabase project for database and authentication
- Configuring Redis for caching and session management
- Setting up Docker for secure agent execution
- Integrating with LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.)
- Configuring web search and scraping capabilities (Tavily, Firecrawl)
- Setting up background job processing and workflows
- Configuring webhook handling for automated tasks
- Optional integrations (RapidAPI, custom data providers)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caioapfelbaum/OperaFlow.git
cd OperaFlow
```

2. **Run the setup wizard**:

```bash
python setup.py
```

The wizard will guide you through 14 steps with progress saving, so you can resume if interrupted.

3. **Start the platform**:

```bash
python start.py
```

### Manual Setup

See the [Self-Hosting Guide](./docs/SELF-HOSTING.md) for detailed manual setup instructions.
